# Realistic evaluation of transductive few-shot learning


##  Introduction
This repo contains the code for our NeurIPS 2021 paper "Realistic evaluation of transductive few-shot learning". This is a framework that regroups all methods evaluated in our paper except for SIB and LR-ICI. Results provided in the paper can be reproduced with this repo. Code was developed under python 3.8.3 and pytorch 1.4.0.


## 1. Getting started


### 1.1 Quick installation (recommended) (Download datasets and models)
To download datasets and pre-trained models (checkpoints), follow instructions 1.1.1 to 1.1.2 of NeurIPS 2020 paper "TIM: Transductive Information Maximization" public implementation (https://github.com/mboudiaf/TIM)

#### 1.1.1 Place datasets
Make sure to place the downloaded datasets (data/ folder) at the root of the directory.

#### 1.1.2 Place models
Make sure to place the downloaded pre-trained models (checkpoints/ folder) at the root of the directory.

### 1.2 Manual installation
Follow instruction 1.2 of NeurIPS 2020 paper "TIM: Transductive Information Maximization" public implementation (https://github.com/mboudiaf/TIM) if facing issues with previous steps. Make sure to place data/ and checkpoints/ folders at the root of the directory.

### 2. Requirements
To install requirements:
```bash
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
```
Where \<env> is the name of your environment

## 3. Reproducing the main results

Before anything, activate the environment:
```python
source activate <env>
```

### 3.1 Table 1 and 2 results in paper

### Evaluation in a 5-shot scenario on ***mini***-Imagenet using RN-18 as backbone (Table 1. in paper)  
| Method        | 1-shot |  5-shot |  10-shot |  20-shot |
| ---           |  ---   | ---     | ---      | ---      | 
| SimpleShot    |  63.0  | 80.1    | 84.0     | 86.1     | 
| PT-MAP        |  60.1 (&#8595;16.8) | 67.1 (&#8595;18.2)| 68.8 (&#8595;18.0)| 70.4 (&#8595;17.4)|
| LaplacianShot | 65.4 (&#8595;4.7)  | 81.6 (&#8595;0.5)| 84.1 (&#8595;0.2)| 86.0 (&#8593;0.5)|
| BDCSPN        | 67.0 (&#8595;2.4)  | 80.2 (&#8595;1.8)| 82.7 (&#8595;1.4)| 84.6 (&#8595;1.1)|   
| TIM           |  67.3 (&#8595;4.5)  |  79.8 (&#8595;4.1)|  82.3 (&#8595;3.8)|  84.2 (&#8595;3.7)|
| &alpha;-TIM  | **67.4**  | **82.5** | **85.9** | **87.9** | 

To reproduce the results from Table 1. and 2. in the paper, from the root of the directory execute this python command.
```python
python3 -m src.main --base_config <path_to_base_config_file> --method_config <path_to_method_config_file> 
```

The <path_to_base_config_file> follows this hierarchy:
```python
config/<balanced or dirichlet>/base_config/<resnet18 or wideres>/<mini or tiered or cub>/base_config.yaml
```

The <path_to_method_config_file> follows this hierarchy:
```python
config/<balanced or dirichlet>/methods_config/<alpha_tim or baseline or baseline_pp or bdcspn or entropy_min or laplacianshot or protonet or pt_map or simpleshot or tim>.yaml
```

For instance, if you want to reproduce the results in the **balanced** setting on mini-Imagenet, using ResNet-18, with alpha-TIM method go to the root of the directory and execute:
```python
python3 -m src.main --base_config config/balanced/base_config/resnet18/mini/base_config.yaml --method_config config/balanced/methods_config/alpha_tim.yaml
```

If you want to reproduce the results in the **randomly balanced** setting on mini-Imagenet, using ResNet-18, with alpha-TIM method go to the root of the directory and execute:
```python
python3 -m src.main --base_config config/dirichlet/base_config/resnet18/mini/base_config.yaml --method_config config/dirichlet/methods_config/alpha_tim.yaml
```

# Reusable data sampler module
One of our main contribution is our realistic task sampling method following Dirichlet's distribution. 
![plot](plots/dirichlet_density_plot.png)

Our realistic sampler can be found in [sampler.py](src/datasets/sampler.py) file. The sampler has been implemented following Pytorch's norms and in a way that it can be easily reused and integrated in other projects.

The following notebook [exemple_realistic_sampler.ipynb](exemple_realistic_sampler.ipynb) is an exemple that shows how to initialize and use our realistic category sampler.
